# Seek A Soul

Seek A Soul is a small project that I developed for the *Womxn Develop at Ubisoft* mentorship program. The goal of the program was to create a game on the theme "Reborn" with the support of a mentor working at Ubisoft. We had 2 months to code the game in C++ using the API provided by SFML.

## Pitch

Seek A Soul is a 2D platformer where you embody a skeleton who has lost its soul. Avoid enemies and obstacles to accumulate all soul chunks to get through levels so that, once you've reach the end level, you reborn into your new soul.

## Controls

### PC (Mouse + Keyboard)
- Arrow keys or ZQSD (AZERTY keyboard) for Left/Right/Up/Down movements ;
- Mouse to aim
- Right click to throw a bone ;
- Space to skull roll. 

### Controller (PS3)
- Left joystick for Left/Right movements ;
- R1 for Up movements ;
- L1 for Down movements ;
- Right joystick to aim ;
- L2 to throw a bone ;
- O to skull roll.

*Note : these bindings where tested with the PS3 Dualshock controller, if you test with another one, some of them might be different.*
